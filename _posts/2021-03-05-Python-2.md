Most of the programming languages like C, C++, and Java use braces { } to define a block of code. Python, however, uses indentation.

A code block (body of a function, loop, etc.) starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line. The amount of indentation is up to you, but it must be consistent throughout that block.

Here is an example:

You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
