A **Dictionary in Python** is a mutable collection of data values that holds key-value pairs. Each key-value pair in the dictionary maps the key to its associated value making it more optimized. A Dictionary in Python is declared by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs using curly braces: {}.

Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be. The values of a dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.

**Accessing Values in Dictionary**

To access dictionary elements, you can use the familiar square brackets along with the key to obtain its value. Following is a simple example:

![dict_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22170799/113640471-2b39f480-9684-11eb-95fa-76a6940814f2.png)

The code shown above will output the following result:

**$python main.py**

```
16.12.5b
```


There are two important points while using dictionary keys

- More than one entry per key is not allowed ( no duplicate key is allowed)
- Dictionary keys are case sensitive- Same key name but with the different cases are treated as different keys in Python dictionaries.

**Dictionary items() Method**

The items() method returns a list of tuple pairs (Keys, Value) in the dictionary.

The code shown above will output the following result:

**$python main.py**

```
[('model', 'ISR4451'), ('version', '16.12.5b'), ('os', 'IOSXE'), ('uptime', 365)]
```
