In Python, \"for loops\" are called **iterators**. \"For Loop\" depends on the elements it has to iterate.

Syntax:
```
for iterating_var in sequence:
    statements(s)
```

If a sequence contains an expression list, it is evaluated first. Then, the first item in the sequence is assigned to the iterating variable *_iterating\_var_*. Next, the statements block is executed. Each item in the list is assigned to *_iterating\_var_*, and the statement(s) block is executed until the entire sequence is exhausted.

**Example:**
Following is a simple example:
