In this material we will cover the basics of Object Oriented Programming (OOP): class, instance, object, inheritance:

**Class** − A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.

**Instance** − An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.

**Object** − A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.

**Inheritance** − The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.

**Method** − A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.

**Example:**\
